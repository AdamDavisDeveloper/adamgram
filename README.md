## Instagram for those who hate Instagram but want to share photos similarly

This project was inspired by and borrowed html/css code heavily from the <a href="https://github.com/hunterirving/Huntergram">Huntergram</a> project by Hunter Irving. He was kind enough to allow me to use his code and build on it for my own use. Thank you Hunter!
<br>
I decided to build onto Hunter's great idea and create this with Vite, Typescript, React, and Firebase which allowed me to add some cool features like:
<ul>
    <li>Individual post views</li>
    <li>Dynamic routing for easy sharing</li>
    <li>Automatic post counter</li>
    <li>Liking and commenting functionality</li>
    <li>A dedicated, real-time database</li>
    <li>An uploading feature for adding new posts</li>
</ul>
